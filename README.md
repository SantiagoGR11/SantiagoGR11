## 🚀 About Me
I am currently in my third year of a Physics degree at the University of Oviedo, with a strong interest in astrophysics and the application of computational methods to scientific research.

My projects focus on:
- **Data Analysis** of datasets
- **Numerical Simulations** for physical systems
- **3D Animations** for scientific visualization

Currently learning:
- Monte Carlo techniques for probabilistic modeling
- Basic web application development for scientific tools

---

## 🎯 Next Steps
- **Bachelor’s Thesis**: Developing a software tool to act as a first filter for celestial bodies, helping discard irrelevant objects for telescope observation.
- **Future Goal**: Pursue a Master’s in Astrophysics abroad (target: Heidelberg University, DAAD program) and build a career in scientific research.
